# EMPLOYEE SALARY CALCULATOR

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This webpage is a quick tool to calculate your company's monthly labor costs based on yearly salaries, and alert you if the cost exceeds a predetermined value (it's currently set to $20,000)!

You can add individual employees into the calculator by using the provided input fields. Once all the information is entered, click the green submit button after the input fields. The information you entered will appear on a table below the input fields. Below the table, you'll see your monthly labor expenses calculated. If your monthly labor costs exceed $20,000, you'll notice the monthly expenses turn red.

If you'd like to remove an employee from the table to see how their omission would affect your labor costs, simply click the red delete button at the end of the employee's row.
